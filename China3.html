  <h1>History</h1>

<p>Chinese history is long and complex, and while it may appear to be a uniform pattern of dynasty-dynasty-division-dynasty, the ideas and cultural changes that underly this historical pattern have been incredibly varied. <br> <br>
The first Chinese dynasties were the Shang and the Zhou. During the Warring States Priod in the first century BC, The Zhou were competing with many other states for control of China's heartland, and out of the chaos, the ideas of Confucius emerged, with his teachings of harmony and hierarchy.
<br><br>
The Qin Dynasty emerged in 221 BC, ending the Warring States Period. The Qin Dynasty didn't last long but it set a precedent for future forms of government, it also built incredible projects, such as the walls that would become the great wall. After a peasant uprising, the Qin dynasty collapsed and the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD) took over. The Han Dynasty saw the introducton of Confucian ideas to official laws. The Han Dynasty also traded along the Silk Road with other parts of Asia, increasing China's influence. Chinese culture also began to influence the cultures of Vietnam and the Korean Peninsula.
<br><br>
From the 3rd century AD to the late 6th century AD, China was disunited again. Rival kingdoms competed for power in the North, and cultural divisions formed between the North and South. Eventually, the Sui Dynasty (581-618) emerged and united the North and South by constructing the Great Canal. But after three unsuccessful invasions of Korea, the leader Sui Yangdi was assasinated in 618 by one of his officials.
<br><br>
The Tang Dynasty (618-907) was one of the more outward-looking Dynasties. The Tang strongly promoted Buddhism, and under the Tang, Cosmopolitan influences from other regions could easily be seen in cities and markets. The time has since been regarded as the pinnacle of Chinese literary and and artistic output. But after exhausting a lot of resources to defeat the rebellion of An Lushan, the Tang's power was weakened and their control over Chinese provinces was lessened. In the last century of the dynasty, Buddhism was outlawed, and even after the ban was changed, it would never regain its former status. In general, the Dynasty became more inward-looking. It faced growing upheaval and fragility, which ultimately lead to its downfall.
<br><br>
After a short period of disunity known as the Five Kingdoms period, the Tang Dynasty was followed by the Song Dynasty (960-1127), which had its northern capital of Kaifeng lost to rebels. When the Song retreated to Hangzhou, the society became culturally and economically successful. The sciences also flourished. The Song also introduced a system of examinations for entry into Chinese bureaucracy.
<br><br>
The Song Dynasty did not last, and after its fall, the Mongols took the opportunity to conquer China. Hangzhou, which had been the bastion of Song resistance, fell in 1276. The Yuan dynasty was then established as Beijing was rebuilt after the Mongol invasion, and transformed into the national capital. Still, the Mongols proved to be far less effective in politics than in warfare, and in 1368 the Ming Dynasty was established. The Ming moved their capital from Nanjing to Beijing, and under the Ming Dynasty, much commercial growth and social change took place. Female literacy increased, and books in the form of novels began to be published. The Great-Wall was bolsterd by the addition of brick, and traders from Europe introduced new crops. <br><br>
Internal struggles, droughts, and famine reduced the wealth and power of the Ming Dynasty. The Manchus, an aggressive people from the North took the opportunity to invade Beijing, and established the Qing dynasty in 1644. While Qing rulers appreciated Chinese culture and tried to win support of Han Chinese officials this way, they maintained segregation in cities between themselves and the Han. In addition, Major territorial expansion took place during the Qing Dynasty, shaping the borders of China as we know it today. The trade routes with Europe also expanded in number and became more lucrative. But in 19th century, things turned sour.<br><br>
The Taiping rebellion of 1850-1864 was brutal. It was an anti-Manchu effort partly motivated by the introduction of Christianity to the Hakka people. The Taiping had their capital in Nanjing. Eventually, the Qing reconquered it, but it took great efforts and many people died. Further events then continued to weaken the Qing, such as the Opium Wars which were been won by Britain, in an effort to stop China from banning the Opium trade. In 1842 at the treaty of Nanjing, Hong Kong was ceded to Britain and China was forced to open up more ports to foreign trade. Angered by China's willingness to cave to the west, the violent rebels during Boxer Rebellion further weakened the Qing. The sino-Japanese war of 1894 and 1895 was a struggle for the rule of the Korean Peninsula, and it was won by Japan in a humiliating defeat for the Qing. In addition, the Russo-Japanese war (1904-1905) was fought on Chinese territory. The Qing dynasty came to an abrupt end in 1911, when rebels from Wuhan declared independence.
<br><br>
The Republic of China lasted from 1912 until 1949. The city of Shanghai was very prosperous during this time, but much of China was not. In 1926, the Kuomintang and the newly formed Communist party allied under the instruction of the soviets. Over time, Chiang, the leader of the Kuomintang, became suspicious that the communists were using the alliance to establish more control themselves. Chiang's forces then killed many Communist Party members, who went on the run away from the Coast. Under Kuomintang rule, China regained tariff autonomy for the first time in 90 years, allowing them more say in trade policy.
<br><br>
In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, which forced Chiang to consider strategies for fighting both the communists and Japan. But the communists had not gone away. After their march from the Kuomintang, growing resentment toward Chiang forced him to ally with the communists to defeat Japan. Many Kuomingtang died in the war and their party was weakened. While some communists died in the war too, in the long run, it helped the communists establish power. With Japan defeated, the Kuomintang and communists were enemies once again. After 3 years of civil war, the communisty party took over on October 1, 1949. Chiang and the remaining Kuomingtang fled to Taiwan, which became known as the Republic of China (while the mainland was known as the People's Republic of China).
<br><br>
Under Mao Zedong in communist China, relations with the soviets broke down. Mao attempted a set of policies to collectivise farming and encourage industry, known collectively as the Great Leap Forward. These policies were a huge failure and lead to large famines. Still, Mao was able to encourage fervor, and in the 1960s, young rebels known as "Red Guards" stormed many cities, murdering capitalists, landlords, and intellectuals in a time known as the Cultural Revolution. In 1969, the army forced the red guards off the streets. In the 1970s, China began to reopen to the west. President Richard Nixon made his iconic visit. From the 1970s, major reforms were made which opened China far more to capitalist economic influence, and which catapaulted China's economy to being the fastest growing on Earth. The events at Tiannamen Square were a shock to the world when they took place in 1989, but China continued to rise. Poverty has decreased tremendously, and a large middle class has emerged. During the recession of 2008, a stimulus package of infrastructure and housing construction was enacted to keep China's economy afloat. While a lot of great infrastructure was built, many of the new urban developments remained largely empty, known as "Ghost Cities". China's growth slowed down in the mid-2010s but the economic rise to superpower is status is continuing to take place.

</p>

<h1>Culture</h1>
<p><strong>Demographic Makeup</strong></p>
<p>While the fact that 92% of Chinese are ethnic Han Chinese may make the society appear uniform to a westerner, the reality is anything but. Within the han ethnic group, the customs and culture vary heavily from region to region. The mosaic of other ethnic groups has also influenced the culture of the regions, even if they don't make up large percentages of the population. That being said, there is some sense of unity, and  commonalities fundamental to Chinese culture as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Religion and Spiritual Practice</strong></p>
<p>Chinese religious and philosophical ideas, such as Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, have influenced the national identity in various ways throughout the ages. Confucianism teaches the value of societal harmony, and stresses the importance that one knows ones place within the social hierarchy. Taoism is centred on the enigmatic concept of the Tao, an all-knowing but chaotic "force" that provides balance of Yin and Yang, various contrasting ideas. Buddhism has historically been very popular among Imperial nobles in China, which is why a lot of Imperial architecture was similar to that of Buddhist temples.</p>
<p><strong>Arts</strong></p>
<p>The Visual Arts of China vary from their regions and times of origin. Calligraphy, Ink Painting, Ceramics, and Buddhist Sculpture are the most well-recognized elements of Chinese visual art. Much Chinese visual art shows an element of restraint. Some forms of Chinese art in the past, such as Buddhist Sculpture, strictly followed traditions that took centuries to change, if at all. Others consistently changed with the times. Today, contemporary Chinese art is conistently pushing the boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong></p>
<p>China has a very distinct pre-modern architectural tradition, and the styles it encompasses fall into three major categories: Imperial architecture, common architecture, and religious architecture. Imperial architecture is generally imposing and makes heavy use of yellow roof tiles and red walls. Common architecture traditionally featured tight living quarters around inner courtyards, and varied between regions of China. Religious architecture is the most varied. Buddhist temples strongly resembled imperial architecture, whereas Taoist temples resembled common architecture. Confucian architecture was majestic on the outside, but on the inside, quite plain and lacking in imagery, meant to encourage self-reflection rather than bring focus to material possessions. </p>
<p>Modern architecture, while sometimes influenced by the guiding principles of Feng Shui, is generally a case of anything-goes. The futuristic, tall, and sometimes downright weird 21st-century Chinese buildings are extremely numerous in the major cities. There are few zoning laws in these cities, and a large pool of cheap labor.</p>
<p><strong>Cuisine</strong></p>
<p>Chinese cuisine is extremely diverse and varies heavily from region to region. Many regional specialties are no longer limited to their places of origin, however, and can now be found in restaurants all over the major cities. Chinese cooking relies heavily on the equal balancing of ingredients and flavours: sweetness with sourness, vegetables with meats, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Events and Festivals</strong></p>
<p>Traditional festivals are found all over China. Some, like the Dragon Boat Festival, are nationwide, while others are limited to certain regions. Perhaps the most well known Chinese holiday worldwide is the Chinese New Year. While there are many things in common between celebratons, the holiday varies from region to region, and between different countries' diasporas. </p>
<h1>Trip Planning</h1>
<p>There is an incredibly huge variety of travel experiences one can have in China. That being said, three cities form the anchorpoint of many itineraries: Xi'an, Beijing, and Shanghai. If you only have a couple of weeks, prioritize these cities. When planning trips longer than that, the traveler should read about the regions (see below) to see destinations and activities that interest them. Most destinations can be easily reached on public transport, although some high speed rail links between major cities are still not complete. If you're trying to save money, a sleeper train ride is likely at some point if you are seeing more than one major region of the country.</p>
<p>The most important thing to keep in mind for your transport times and for your wallet is geography: as a general rule-of-thumb, the further away from the Coast you go, the cheaper it gets.</p>
<p>There are many, many interesting places to go in China. Importantly, even on trips as long as two months, travelers will have to make some difficult decisions about where to go. Inevitably, hard choices will be made and "must-see" places on regional itineraries will end up getting left out. Some travelers choose to see the highlights of several regions that interest them, whereas other travelers stay in one general region of the country to really get a feel for it. What you do is up to you, but either way, planning will involve reading about great places you end up skipping. </p>
<br>
<h3>Regions</h3>
<h1>
The Northeast - Heliongjang, Jilin, Liaoning
</h1>
<p>A cold, historically industrial region little visited by westerners, this is the homeland of the Manchu, the ethnic group which ruled China during the Qing dynasty period. Because of its location and borders, the region has heavy Russian and Korean cultural influences.</p>
<h1>
Beijing, Tianjin, and the North - Hebei, Shandong, and Inner Mongolia
</h1>
<p>Since the Yuan Dynasty in the 13th century, this has been the political heartland of China. The region has an incredible variety of iconic sights related to Chinese history, and between the boulevards of Beijing lie the traditional Hutongs, which give travelers a glimpse of "Old China".</p>

<h1>
Shanghai and the Eastern Provinces - Jiangsu, Zhejiang
</h1>
<p>
Historically one of the wealthiest regions of Asia, this region suffered greatly in the mid 20th century due to war and poverty, but it has modernized rapidly since the 1990s. Shanghai has historically been the most westernized city in mainland China, but its surrounding regions have towns with the architecture of the textbook "Old China".

<h1>
Inland Provinces - Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Henan
</h1>
<p>The central area of Han China. While these provinces are among the least affluent provinces of Han China today, they are home to incredible historic sites and areas of natural beauty.  </p>
<h1>
Guangzhou and the Southern Provinces, Guandong, Fujian, Hainan
</h1>
<p>
South of major mountain ranges and with its own unique languages and dialects, this region is a culturally distinct area from the Mandarin-speaking parts of China. The area has historically been very outward looking and trade-oriented. Today, it is the ancestral homeland of many Chinese in the western world.
</p>
<h1>
The Southwest - Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi 
</h1>
<p>
The most ethnically diverse region of China, this is the region where East Asian culture meets Southeast Asian culture. It is also home to many of China's most beuatiful natural landscapes, from the rugged rainforests of Southern Yunnan to the distinct Karst peaks of Guangxi.

<h1>
Xi'an and the Central North Provinces - Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Gansu, Ningxia
</h1>
<p>In ancient times, this region was where Chinese civilization truly established itself - culturally, politically, and economically. The city of Xi'an was also the beginning of the silk road, the great trading route which connected East Asia with the Middle East and the Western World. </p>
<h1>
The Northwest - Xinjiang, Qinghai
</h1>
<p>This region is home to Tibetan populations and to the Ughyur people, a Muslim Turkic ethnic group. With its seemingly endless deserts, huge mountains, and far less population density than in other parts of China, the Northwest fascinates intrepid travelers. </p>
<h1>
Tibet
</h1>
<p>A permit and tour are needed to travel here, and the security situation can be unpredictable. Still, visiting "The Roof of the World" gives travelers a glimpse into a landscape and heritage with nothing resembling it elsewhere on Earth. </p>
